# Better Excel and Groovy Quickstart
Some templates to get you started writing custom Jira reports, using Better Excel plugin and Jira / Scriptrunner 

I think that the hardest part of using these type of tools is finding the documentation, which is spread across several sites or throughout Atlassian answers.  So this repository is meant as a quick place to find the most common files I've used to get going.

Many files are taken from the official documentation at: https://www.midori-global.com/products/better-excel-exporter-for-jira/server/documentation/recipes.
