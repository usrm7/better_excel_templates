# Better Excel and Groovy Quickstart
Some templates to get you started writing custom Jira reports, using the [Better Excel](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1212652/better-excel-exporter-for-jira?hosting=server&tab=overview) plugin. 

Formatting:  
See [formatting](formatting.MD). 

Templates and scripts:
Many files are taken from the [official documentation](https://www.midori-global.com/products/better-excel-exporter-for-jira/server/documentation/recipes).  
You may also want to use ScriptRunner for Jira to test out Groovy scripts separately from your Better Excel templates.
